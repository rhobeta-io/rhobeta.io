Techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used for predicting sequential data patterns, such as weather forecasts, election outcomes, housing market trends, and stock market movements. The goal is to strike a balance between emphasizing recent events and older patterns to identify the most crucial factors influencing tomorrow's or next week's stock prices. Machine learning models assign weights to each market indicator, determining how much historical context to consider for accurate predictions.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/03/stocks-python/#stock-price-prediction-using-moving-average-time-series","title":"Stock Price Prediction using Moving Average Time Series","text":"<p>To start exploring how much history to consider, we can employ a simple yet effective approach: moving averages (MA). A basic moving average calculates the mean of the past N data points and uses this value as the predicted N+1 value. This allows us to examine how varying the number of historical data points affects the model's performance. So,</p> <p></p> <p>To predict the present stock price using moving averages, we consider the previous n data points (P1 to Pn). To do this, we calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of those past n data points and use it as our predicted value. The choice of n significantly affects the model's accuracy. A higher n means examining more historical data points to compute the present value.</p> <p>For instance, if n=2, we take the average of the stock price over the past two days. Conversely, if n=50, we consider 50 days' worth of stock prices, which would provide more insight into trends and potentially lead to better predictions. However, a large n can also introduce instability by smoothing out granular fluctuations.</p> <p>To address this issue, another type of moving average is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which assigns greater weight to more recent data points. This allows us to consider more historical data while still capturing recent trends and fluctuations in stock prices.</p> <p></p> <p>In EMA, each past data point <code>Pt</code> has a weight <code>k</code>, where:</p> <ul> <li><code>Pt</code> is the price at time <code>t</code></li> <li><code>k</code> is the weight given to that data point</li> <li><code>EMA(t-1)</code> represents the value computed from the past <code>t-1</code> points</li> </ul> <p>The weight <code>k</code> is calculated as:</p> <ul> <li><code>k = 2/(N+1)</code></li> </ul> <p>This EMA approach performs better than a simple Moving Average (SMA), as it assigns higher weights to more recent data points. This assumption holds true for stock prices as time series data.</p> <p>Comparison of SMA and EMA</p> <p>EMA outperforms SMA by considering more past data and giving more importance to newer samples. However, its fixed parameters can be limiting in certain cases.</p> <ul> <li>In EMA, the value of <code>k</code> (the weight/significance of past data) is linked to the window size <code>N</code> (how much past we   wish to consider).</li> <li>Manually setting these parameters can be challenging, and optimizing them for a project like stock market prediction   using machine learning might be impossible.</li> </ul> <p>Next Steps</p> <p>To overcome these limitations, we can use more complex models that can compute the significance of each past data point and optimize our predictions. This can be achieved by updating weights while training a machine learning model.</p> <p>LSTM Model</p> <p>Considering the importance of past data in computing future values, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model comes to mind as a suitable approach for stock market prediction using machine learning.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/03/stocks-python/#long-short-term-memory-network-for-stock-price-prediction","title":"Long Short Term Memory Network for Stock Price Prediction","text":"<p>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Network</p> <p>The LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that specializes in processing sequential data, such as time series data like stock prices.
